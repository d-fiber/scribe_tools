   * `penalty`, and holding out again lengthens it up to `maxPenalty`. That is
   * what makes a script back off instead of retrying at the same pace.
   *
   * An address is shared, by an office or by a carrier's NAT, so the framework
   * shortens `maxPenalty` on its own when the caller is one: punishing an
   * address for a quarter of an hour punishes whoever else is behind it.
